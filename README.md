# Eltton Araujo
<sub>*Graduate student in computer vision</sub>

As a novice data scientist, I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in team environments and attention to detail. Having spent the last few years applying statistical models to measure aspects of dependability in IoT systems, I developed critical thinking and problem solving skills.

My credentials include a master's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), an institution of higher education and advanced research as one of the best and most prestigious computer schools in Brazil, and I am currently a graduate student in computer vision at Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE).

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Dependability model, and Statistic.
